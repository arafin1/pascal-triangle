1.  In Pascal’s triangle, the sum of all the numbers of a row is twice the sum of all the numbers of the previous row. 
So, the sum of 2nd row is 1+1= 2, and that of 1st is 1. Again, the sum of 3rd row  is 1+2+1 =4, 
and that of 2nd row is 1+1 =2, and so on. This major property is utilized here in Pascal’s triangle algorithm.
2.  The edges, left and right, of the triangle consist of “1”s only.
3.  And, all the elements outside the triangle are “0”s.
4.  The sequence of the product of each element or number is related to e, the base of the natural logarithm.
5.  The diagonal next to the edge diagonal, in both left and right, contain natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ….) in order.
6.  The sum of the squares of the numbers of row “n” equals the middle number of row “2n”.
